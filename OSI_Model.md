# What is The OSI Model 
Open System Interconnection Model known as OSI Model is a major protocol model that describes various forms of network system or communication.
The OSI model consists of seven layers that display how data is sent and received across a network. 
The primary goal is to demonstrate how the various layers of communications are layered over one another, starting with physical cabling and concluding with the application that interacts with users or other devices on a network. 





## The 7 Layers of OSI Model: 


### Layer 7: Application Layer
Responsible for user interface

### Layer 6: Presentation Layer
Responsible for the receiver understands sent data 

### Layer 5: Session Layer
Responsible for stabilizes connections

### Layer 4: Transfer Layer
Responsible for communication

### Layer 3: Network Layer

OSI model is known for defining how different applications communicate over connected networks
* Including: 
  * LAN (Local Area Network) 
  * MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
  * WAN (Wide Area Network)
  * etc.


What is Local Area Network (LAN)?
> A local area network (LAN) connects multiple or a group of network-connected devices with a limited range or localized region, such as a coffee shop, library, or school. 
> This network is mostly used for sharing hardware resources such as computers, printers, televisions, and other devices. In comparison to MAN and WAN, LAN has a greater data transmission speed and implements private network addresses for connectivity and data exchange. It also uses cable for network connection, which reduces mistake and maintains data security.

What is Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)?
> A metropolitan area network connects small areas or regions like cities or towns. This network is larger than a LAN but not as large as a WAN. 
> MAN can be used to connect numerous LAN networks to form a metropolitan range; for example, a MAN network can connect all of a company's branches in the same city. 
> The networked region is typically connected by wired networks, such as optical cables and connections.

What is Wide Area Network (WAN)?
> A WAN connects devices across extensive areas such as a state, country, or continent. The WAN network is larger than the LAN and MAN networks, its connection is usually wireless since it uses radio towers for communication, and the geographical area is usually made up of multiple interconnected LAN and MAN networks. 
> Because of the large distance covered, the speed of WAN data transfer is slower than that of LAN and MAN.



### Layer 2: Data Link Layer
Deals with Bits and Bytes

### Layer 1: Physical Layer
The physical layer is the first and lowest level of the OSI model, and it deals with the physical connection between devices. It defines hardware components such as cables, wires, connectors, and so on. 
The information is stored in bits (1s and 0s) and is transferred between devices via the node, which is a physical electronic device that is connected to a network.
