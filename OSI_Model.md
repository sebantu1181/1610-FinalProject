# What is The OSI Model 
Open System Interconnection Model known as OSI Model is a major protocol model that describes various forms of network system or communication.






## The 7 Layers of OSI Model: 


### Layer 7: Application Layer
Responsible for displaying data to receiver

### Layer 6: Presentation Layer
Responsible for the receiver understands sent data 

### Layer 5: Session Layer
Responsible for stabilizes connections

### Layer 4: Transfer Layer
Responsible for communication

### Layer 3: Network Layer

OSI model is known for defining how different applications communicate over connected networks
* Including: 
  * LAN (Local Area Network) 
  * MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
  * WAN (Wide Area Network)
  * etc.

  | What is LAN? | LAN network connects multiple or a group of network connected electronics with a limited     |
  |---------|:---------:|
  | What is MAN? | MAN network connects small regeons |
  |----------|:-------- :|
  | What is WAN? | WAN network connects devices over large distance |




#### What is Local Area Network (LAN)?
LAN network connects multiple or a group of network connected electronics with a limited range or local area such as coffee shop, library, school, etc.
This network is mainly utilized for sharing hardware resources including computers, printers, television, and more. LAN is relatively higher with data transfer speed in comparison to MAN and WAN and it uses private network addresses for connectivity and data exchange, it uses cable for network connection, decreasing error and maintaining data security.

#### What is Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)?
MAN network connects small regions such as cities or towns. This network is larger than LAN but smaller than WAN. 
MAN can be used to connect multiple LAN networks to create the metropolitan range, for example MAN network can connect all the branches of a company that exist in the same city. 
The network connected area is usually connected using wired network, like optical cables and connections.

#### What is Wide Area Network (WAN)?
WAN network connects devices over large distance such as state, country, or continent. WAN network is larger than LAN and MAN network, the connection is wireless in most cases because it uses radio tower for communication and the geographical area is usually made up of multiple interconnected LAN and MAN networks. 
The speed of the WAN data transfer is lower than in comparison to LAN and MAN due to the large distance covered.



### Layer 2: Data Link Layer
Deals with Bits and Bytes

### Layer 1: Physical Layer
Deals with Cables and Wires
