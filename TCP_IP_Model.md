# How is TCP/IP different from OSI?

>[!IMPORTANT]
> - TCP/IP is older than the OSI Model
> - a Key difference between the models is that TCP/IP is simpler, collapsing several layers OSI layers into one
> - Session, presentation, and application layers of the OSI model are combined into one Application Layer of TCP/IP
> - Physical and data link layers of the OSI model are combined into Network Access Layer of TCP/IP
